Throughout the course, we will break out of the lecture to explore concepts more thoroughly through computational analysis. We'll write a wide variety of code covering concepts such as mathematical techniques, stochastic simulations, and image processing. Furthermore, we will work through an experimental data set to quantify gene expression in bacterial cells.

## Introductory Materials
Please work through the following tutorials before the beginning of class. The TAs will hold a special session covering these topics on **Sunday, January 15th** from 16:00 to 17:00 in XX.

* [Setting up Python for scientific programming](../../../../code/html/setting_up_python.html)

* [A primer on Python syntax and plotting](../../../../code/html/python_syntax_and_plotting.html)


## Data sets

Please download the following data sets, unzip them, and place them in your `pboc/data` folder as described in the [setting up Python](../../../../code/html/setting_up_python.html) tutorial.

* [Data Set 1](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/sizing_up_ecoli.zip) | A phase contrast image of bacteria and a graticule.
* [Data Set 2](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip) | A series of phase contrast images of a growing *E. coli* colony
* [Data Set 3](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course-data/french_flag.zip) | Images of developing fly embryos for identification of the position of the cephalic furrow.
* [Data Set 4](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/lacI_titration.zip) | A large image set of *E. coli* strains with varying copy numbers of the lacI repressor molecule.


## Course Python Utilities
As sometimes syntax can be difficult, we have written a file with a few functions written in Python that will make some of the in-class exercises less cumbersome. Please download them below and place them in your root `pboc` folder as described in the [setting up Python](../../../../code/html/setting_up_python.html) tutorial.

*[`pboc_utils.py`](../../../../code/pboc_utils.py) | Course utilities.

## Course Exercises.
As we go through the course, the code we write in class will be posted here. When possible, extra tutorials with more detail and explanation will be posted as well.
