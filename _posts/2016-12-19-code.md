Throughout the course, we will break out of the lecture to explore concepts more thoroughly through computational analysis. We'll write a wide variety of code covering concepts such as mathematical techniques, stochastic simulations, and image processing. Furthermore, we will work through an experimental data set to quantify gene expression in bacterial cells.

## Introductory Materials
Please work through the following tutorials before the beginning of class. The TAs will hold a special session covering these topics on **Friday, January 13th** from XX to XX in XX.

* [Setting up Python for scientific programming](../../../../code/html/setting_up_python.html)

* [A primer on Python syntax and plotting](../../../../code/html/python_syntax_and_plotting.html)

## Course Exercises.
As we go through the course, the code we write in class will be posted here. When possible, extra tutorials with more detail and explanation will be posted as well.
