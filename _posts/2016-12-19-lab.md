- **Lab \|** 19:00 - 22:00 in College B.416 (Wet Lab) and College B.214 (Optical Tweezer Lab).

## Handouts
Every student will have the opportunity to build an optical tweezer microscope as well as perform wet-lab experiments for the quantification of gene expression. Optional handouts for these materials can be found here:

* [Quantifying Gene Expression: Titrating the *Lac* repressor](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/laci_titration.pdf)

## Data Sets
Data sets from both the fluorescence microscopy lab and the optical tweezer labs will be linked below. As these files are large, they will only be available for download through February 28th, 2017. If you wish to download these data sets past this date, please send Griffin an email.
