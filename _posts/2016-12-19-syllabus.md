<td> Sunday, January 15 </td>
<td>  Setting up Python. <b> Held from 16:00 - 17:00. </b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Monday, January 16 </td>
<td> Welcome to the revolution! We will discuss the importance of physical reasoning and numeracy in approaching biological problems and perform some back-of-the-envelope estimates of cells, the cost of a gene, and the central dogma. We will also introduce and quantitatively explore principles of biological specificity. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Tuesday, January 17 </td>
<td> We will wrap up our discussion about biological specificity by examining allosteric interactions and Maxwell's demon. We will also introduce probability as the language of quantitative biology by playing with biological coin flips. Using our knowledge of probability and specificity to examine chemotaxis, the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux model, adaptation, and the relationship between cytoskeletal remodeling and cell signaling.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Wednesday, January 18 </td>
<td> We will thoroughly explore quantitative descriptions of transcriptional regulation.</td>
</tr>
<td> Thursday, January 19 </td>
<td> What shapes a cell? We will discuss the organization and mechanics of membranes and discuss the organization of cell shape and compartmentalization through phase transitions.</td>
</tr>
<td> Friday, January 20</td>
<td> Biophysics and evolution speak the same language. We will explore physical descriptions of evolution including the fundamental driving forces of evolution such as selection and drift as well as evolutionary models of transcription factor binding. We will spend the final part of the course reviewing what we've learned in five short days. </td></tr>
